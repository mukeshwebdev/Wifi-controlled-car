# Wifi-controlled-car

The Wi-Fi Controlled Car is a smart robotic vehicle designed to be operated remotely using a web-based interface or mobile app. Built using an ESP32 microcontroller, it connects to a Wi-Fi network, allowing seamless real-time control of the carâ€™s movement.

# Key Features
# Hardware Components
ESP32: Handles Wi-Fi communication and motor control.

Motor Driver Module (L298N or L293D): Controls the DC motors for movement.

DC Motors: Enables forward, backward, left, and right motion.

Power Supply: Rechargeable battery or external power source.

Servo Motor (Optional): Can be added for camera rotation in surveillance applications.

# Software & Connectivity
Web-based Control Panel: A simple web interface hosted on ESP32 allows users to control the car via Wi-Fi.

Mobile App Compatibility: Can be integrated with a custom app or Blynk for easy smartphone control.

Real-time Response: Low-latency movement commands over Wi-Fi.

OTA (Over-the-Air) Updates: Enables remote firmware updates for feature enhancements.

# Additional Features
Obstacle Detection (Optional): Can integrate ultrasonic sensors to avoid collisions.

Camera Module (Optional): ESP32-CAM can be added for live video streaming.

Speed Control: PWM-based speed regulation for smooth motion.

# Technology Stack
Microcontroller: ESP32

Programming Language: C++ (Arduino IDE)

Communication: Wi-Fi (Access Point or Station Mode)

Control Interface: HTML, JavaScript (for web UI)
